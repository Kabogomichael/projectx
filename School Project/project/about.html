                    <p>In thinking about the effectiveness of a grant application, we should consider 
                        who will read it and how.  Committee members and referees have different needs and 
                        derive different benefits  from repetition.

                        The most important readers are the committee members that make the decision.
                          All of them will have a vote in deciding whether or not the grant application 
                          gets funded. Few, if any,  will understand the details of the research topic. 
                          All of them will read the summary and most of them will stop there. Some will try 
                          to read the application and understand it. Usually two  members of the committee, 
                          the designated members, are tasked with reading the application and leading the committee discussion.
                           They will try hard to understand the application, but they will find it very difficult and they
                            won't have much time - maybe an hour. Any help you give them will be gratefully received.  
                            Although most of the rest of the committee will not read the application they will probably
                             glance through it during the discussion.
